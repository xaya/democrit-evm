# Democrit for EVM Chains

This repository contains the smart contracts required to implement
Democrit (atomic trading) for Xaya applications running on EVM-based
blockchains.  It is built upon the
[`XayaAccounts`](https://github.com/xaya/polygon-contract) and
[`XayaDelegation`](https://github.com/xaya/delegation-contract) contracts.

The protocol is discussed in more detail in the
[design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16B-vPKtpjbiCl6XCQaO2-7p8xN-2o5JveYJDHVCIxAw/edit?usp=sharing).
